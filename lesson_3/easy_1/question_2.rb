# The ! symbol often times are mutable, while
# a ? usually returns true or false scenarios

# 1. != means does not equal to, and can be used
# when you want the opposite expression
# 2. Putting ! before a variable gives you the opposite
# truthiness of the variable
# 3. Putting ! after a caller, causes a mutation to the
# given object
# 4. Putting ? before something gives an error
# 5. Putting ? determines the return truthiness of method
# 6. Putting a !! gives you the original variable, whereas
# a ! is opposite, and !! is opposite of opposite, or original
